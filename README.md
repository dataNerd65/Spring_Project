I've been looking for a language that works for me well and have been in the journey of discovery in my time in school. I started out 
using python as soon as I purchased my laptop. Python never went well with me since i did mostly well on simple things but in complicated 
tasks it wasn't as good as I wanted. I explored its fields such as Machine Learning, Data Science but still i felt not at home. 
I settled on C++ and used it to solve DSA questions and later took on a transition to java. Java has been a home to me and now am learning its backend
framework called Spring. With minimal help I can do an API , a simple one of course.
